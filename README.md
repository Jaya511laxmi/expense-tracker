##  Overview

<code>Expense-Tracker is a lightweight backend service built with Spring Boot for managing personal expenses. It exposes a simple REST API to add, view, edit and delete expense records. The service is designed to be easy to run locally (H2 in-memory DB by default) and to be deployable as a standalone JAR. This repository contains the backend only (model, repository, service, controller and templates for a minimal UI).</code>

---

##  Features

<code>Create, read, update and delete expense records (CRUD).
Simple domain model: Expense with fields such as id, title, amount, date, category, description.
Service layer with basic validation and repository abstraction (Spring Data JPA).
H2 in-memory database for quick local development.
Ready to extend for authentication, reporting, or frontend integration.
</code>
